## About

I build systems.

My work sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence, quantitative trading, and execution infrastructure.  
I focus on designing data-driven trading architectures, automation frameworks, and scalable education platforms for global Chinese learners.

I believe markets reward structure, not emotion.  
Code is the language of modern finance.
